Electrophysiology in barrel cortex during corridor tracking
===========================================================

To examine other cortical layers, and to verify the response properties
observed with calcium imag- ing, we made extracellular recordings from
barrel cortex in a separate group of mice running through the winding
corridor (Figure 4a) (13 mice). We used 32-channel single shank silicon probes

in mice expressing ChR2-eYFP in layer 4 neurons (Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre x Ai32).
We targeted recordings to barrel field by visualizing the eYFP
fluorescence during surgery. The probe was coated with DiI, allowing us
to reconstruct the probe location within the barrel cortex (Figure 4b).
Recordings were clustered around the C2 barrel (Figure 4—figure
supplement 1a). Current source density analysis triggered on layer 4
activation of ChR2 and electrolytic lesions were used to calibrate
the laminar location of the probe and determine the depth of the
recorded neurons (Figure 4—figure supple- ment 1b). Recordings spanned
layer 2 to layer 5, although the majority of units were located in
infra- granular layers (Figure 4—figure supplement 2a). Baseline and
peak spike rates were higher in deeper layer neurons (Figure 4—figure
supplement 2b,c). Spike sorting was performed manually, and both false
alarm rate of the inter-spike-interval distribution < 1.5% and waveform
SNR > 6 were used as quality control metrics (Figure 4—figure supplement
1c,f). As with the imaging experi- ments, analysis was restricted to
periods of running (speed > 3 cm/s), ensuring the mice were actively
whisking (Sofroniew et al., 2014).
